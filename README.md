# About Me

## To Whomever It May Concern,

This guy is still figuring out his missing `;`. But hey, life's a lot like coding—full of bugs, but you keep debugging until something works (or you just comment it out and move on).

## The Journey So Far

- **Past Lives**: I've juggled jobs from flipping chicken at Popeyes to guarding the gates at high-profile events. I've even dabbled in security—so yeah, I've seen some things.
  
- **Current Quest**: I'm deep into the world of code, chasing down bugs, and building the next big thing (or at least trying to). By day, I'm a Software Engineer Intern at Project Human City, leading feature development and playing nice with the Product Owner and CTO.

- **Side Quests**: When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, experimenting with new programming languages, or diving into the occasional video game marathon. Oh, and trying to find something to watch.

## Skills & Powers

- **Languages**: Fluent in code, sarcasm, and occasional late-night ramblings.
  
- **Special Abilities**: Turning coffee into code, solving mysteries like missing `;`, and making sense of chaos (most of the time).

- **Web Wizardry**: I can conjure up web apps with the flick of a wrist (or a few lines of code) using frameworks like Next.js, Flask, Express, and Django. Frontend, backend—doesn't matter; it's all part of the magic.

- **Microcontroller Maestro**: When it comes to programming microcontrollers, I'm practically a sorcerer. Whether it's C or C++, I make those little circuits dance to my tune.

- **Cloud Commander**: Need to deploy something in the cloud? I've got the skills to tame AWS and Docker, ensuring your apps run smoother than a buttered server.

- **AI Alchemist**: My theoretical knowledge of machine learning and AI is solid—like, "could probably pass a Turing test" solid. I've also dabbled in the practical side, working with LLM frameworks like LlamaIndex and LangChain to create some seriously cool stuff.

- **Debugging Detective**: Got a bug that's eluding you? Consider it caught. I've got a knack for tracking down even the most elusive issues, whether they're in code or lurking somewhere in the depths of a project.

## The Fine Print

Still a work in progress, just like this README. Stick around—things are bound to get interesting.
