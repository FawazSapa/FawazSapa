# About Me

## To Whomever It May Concern(Here's me trying to be funny),

  I'm deep into the world of code, chasing down bugs, and building the next big thing (or at least trying to).I always convince myself that working on projects opens more doors than grinding through LeetCode. Haha!(I am doomed). When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, experimenting with my microcontroller, or diving into the occasional video game marathon. Oh, and trying to find something to watch.
