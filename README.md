# About Me

## To Whomever It May Concern(Here's me trying to be funny),

  I'm deep into the world of code, chasing down bugs, and building the next big thing (or at least trying to).I always convince myself that working on projects opens more doors than grinding through LeetCode. Haha!(I am doomed)

- **Side Quests**: When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, experimenting with my microcontroller, or diving into the occasional video game marathon. Oh, and trying to find something to watch.

## Skills

- **Web development**: I can conjure up web apps using frameworks like Next.js, Flask, Express, and Django. Frontend, backend, doesn't matter; it's all part of the magic.

- **Embedded Systems**:Blending machine learning with embedded systems is one of my favorite hobbies,it's like the quirky combination of pineapple on pizza.

- **Cloud**: Need to deploy something in the cloud? I've got the skills to tame AWS and Docker, ensuring your apps run smoother than a buttered server(courtesy of AWS).

- **AI**: My theoretical knowledge of machine learning and AI is solidâ€”like, "could probably pass that bladerunner test " solid. I've applied this expertise in content moderation, form optimization, and real-time object detection, all thanks to the powerful black-box magic of neural networks xd.
